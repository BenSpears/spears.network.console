title: The Normalization of Spyware
---


In today's digital world, our privacy is under threat more than ever before. Spyware, hidden within many popular software programs, is becoming normalized. While most people don't read terms and conditions, they also never consider looking at the privacy policy to see how their data is used, analyzed, and/or stored. Take Windows, for example. With each update, Microsoft adds more features - inadvertently leading to the collection of even more data from users. They say it's for improving the system, but it often goes too far, collecting more data than we realize â€“ from innocuous diagnostics to invasive monitoring of our every digital move. It's also impossible to opt out of or block. Microsoft contacts thousands of websites for analytics. Of course, you can use programs such as "O&O Shutup" to reduce some of it, but you have to continuously reapply changes made by the program because they are removed upon the next Windows update.

And it's not just Windows. Many other programs, from email apps to media players, also gather data without us knowing. This hidden tracking raises serious questions about our privacy and how much control we have over our own information.

But there's hope.

There are many alternatives out there that will minimally change your life. However, for this post, I'm only going to focus on operating systems. Linux, an alternative operating system to Windows, stands out as a beacon of privacy in the digital landscape. Unlike proprietary systems like Windows, Linux is built on principles of transparency and user control. I've used Linux for over 15 years; however, lately, I've been able to use it as my primary operating system without any drawbacks (it's improved significantly in the last few years regarding app support). I recommend new users look into Linux Mint, Debian, or Fedora. While each has its own slight/unique advantages, Linux Mint will make more sense out of the box for people coming from Windows. I use Arch, btw - but I wouldn't recommend it to newcomers. It essentially forces you to learn every moving part of your operating system and gives you complete control. I could easily dive into the rabbit hole that is Linux and spend a lot of time on it, but I'm sure this is enough for now.

We need to be more aware of what's happening within our software (phones, computers, common websites). We should push for more transparency and control over data collection. Supporting alternatives like Linux and calling for stronger privacy rules are steps we can take to protect ourselves. It's up to all of us to demand better privacy protections and hold tech companies accountable for their actions. Remember, if you don't agree with their privacy policy, data collections, and/or philosophy - don't use it!
