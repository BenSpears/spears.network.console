They should be promoted more often than they are. However, big companies dominate much of this space by default by either installing software on your computer or using certain methods of directing you to their paid service. Unfortunately many companies are going to paid monthly models that trap you into spending lots over time, and going to free or open-source software can offer better solutions anyway. Ninite is a program that will install and update all your free/open-source programs at once.</p><h2 id=ninite><strong>Ninite</strong></h2><p>allows you to go through a list of software by checking the applications you want. Then you will click on &ldquo;Get your Ninite,&rdquo; and proceed to downloading an executable that will install the list of applications you checked. It really streamlines the whole process as opposed to going out and finding each program by itself. In this article I&rsquo;m going to go over programs I believe are the best options on this list and you should be using. IMPORTANT: Keep your Ninite install file because it doubles as an updater as well.</p><h2 id=software-i-recommend>Software I recommend:</h2><p>This privacy-focused browser ranks as best in my books. It has any add-on you could ask for, great system ram management and theme support. Mozilla has recently introduced Firefox Quantum, which is definitely worth checking out if you are not already using it.</p><h2 id=imgburn><strong>ImgBurn</strong></h2><p>is a disk utility program that will allow you to write ISO files to any external disk (CD, DVD). It is free and has worked very well for me for many years. However, now I mostly copy ISOs to make a boot-able flash drive using a program called Rufus or Etcher.</p><h2 id=discord><strong>Discord</strong></h2><p>is a program that will allow you to join or host a group voice channel or text channel. It&rsquo;s free and has many options such as screen sharing as well.</p><h2 id=thunderbird><strong>Thunderbird</strong></h2><p>is a local program from Mozilla (same creator of Firefox) that supports POP or IMAP protocols. It works very well if you are looking for a desktop email client.</p><h2 id=7zip><strong>7Zip</strong></h2><p>I have been using this compression application for years. Whether you are compressing, encrypting or archiving it will work wonders. It will literally unpack 31 different file formats and pack/unpack in seven file formats. It is way better than WinRAR in my opinion and will be on all of my computers.</p><h2 id=vlc><strong>VLC</strong></h2><p>This program is portable, installable, cross-platform and supports streaming from a media server. This is the best open source video player available, hands down.</p><h2 id=foobar2000><strong>Foobar2000</strong></h2><p>This is much like VLC Player, however, it&rsquo;s for playing music files. It supports anything Windows Media Player will, including CD ripping onto your hard drive. The extensions are endless, and it is very customizable. Hands down, this is the best music player you can have in your software arsenal.</p><h2 id=audacity><strong>Audacity</strong></h2><p>is the best free and open source audio recorder in my opinion. I don&rsquo;t have a lot to say about this program other than it is free and will effectively do the job extremely well with all the options you can have with altering your recordings. Like most of the programs on this list, this is very powerful.</p><h2 id=handbrake><strong>Handbrake</strong></h2><p>is an encoding program that can help you convert ISOs to video formats, rip DVDs to video formats or compress videos for different platforms. For example: it can optimize a video file for streaming so that it loads in chapters as opposed to the whole thing having to load first. I highly recommend it.</p><h2 id=filezilla><strong>FileZilla</strong></h2><p>is a free cross-platform FTP application.</p><h2 id=notepad><strong>Notepad++</strong></h2><p>is a text editor that is focused for a code editor. It supports tabs and many different languages. It features syntax highlighting, screenshots and word auto-completion.</p><h2 id=gimp><strong>GIMP</strong></h2><p>is the free Photoshop. It is supported on all major operation systems. It is very powerful but does take some extra time to get the hang of. I have been using it for years, and even though at times I buy a few months of a Photoshop subscription though Adobe, I will still keep this application on my computer.</p><h2 id=libreoffice><strong>LibreOffice</strong></h2><p>is much like Microsoft Office but it&rsquo;s free! I used this all throughout college instead of buying an Office subscription. You can save documents, spreadsheets, slideshows and more in a Microsoft Office recognizable format. No one will be able to tell the difference.</p><h2 id=qbittorrent><strong>qBittorrent</strong></h2><p>is a torrent client that isn&rsquo;t as bloated as newer versions of uTorrent. It is really useful for downloading things such as Linux distributions.</p><h2 id=keepass2><strong>KeePass2</strong></h2><p>allows you to store username and passwords that are highly encrypted and can be accessed using only one strong master password. It can boost your online security greatly as long as you keep your database file protected. I use Dashlane for this as I feel everyone should be using a password manager. However, this is the best free open source alternative. You will have the ability to export your database file from KeePass and manually move it over to your smartphone to access there. Dashlane streamlines this for you but costs around $40 per year.</p><h2 id=everything><strong>Everything</strong></h2><p>is the ultimate windows searching tool. It works way better than using the built-in Windows search utility and will rapidly find files/folder names faster than anything that I have used.</p></div><div style=flex-grow:1></div><div class=container><div class=footer>Benjamin Spears</div></div><script type=text/javascript>var dayToggle=document.querySelector("#day-switch"),nightToggle=document.querySelector("#night-switch");dayToggle.addEventListener("click",()=>changeThemeModeClick(0)),nightToggle.addEventListener("click",()=>changeThemeModeClick(1))</script></body></html>
